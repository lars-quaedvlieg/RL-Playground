# # Double Deep Q-Learning
# 
# > The original paper introducing Double Deep Q-Learning, was published by authors from Google DeepMind back in 2016. Its title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning". In this section, we explain how techniques used in this paper improve upon the standard Deep Q-Learning agent. We also show how one can implement the algorithm, and how to apply it to a problem.
