# The Reinforcement Learning Playground

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning playground! We are happy to have you here.

The RL-playground is an open-source and interactive book that has been created by 
[Lars Quaedvlieg](https://larsquaedvlieg.com/) to learn more about the field of Reinforcement learning.

The book will cover theory about multiple topics, and come with code implementations and examples whenever possible.

The book is currently a **work in progress**, but eventually, the following topics should be discussed:
