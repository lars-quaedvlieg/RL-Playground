Welcome to the **Reinforcement Learning Playground**! We are happy that you have decided to give our book a try. 

The RL-playground is an open-source and interactive book project that has been initiated, hoping to inspire people to 
get into the exciting field of Reinforcement Learning. The book itself has been created with the help of many 
{doc}`maintainers and contributors <./credits>`.

The book will cover the mathematical theories of multiple topics from the field. However, whenever possible, 
these will be accompanied by code implementations and examples. This aims to make learning more interactive, practical 
and fun! 

The target audience of this book is anyone who would want to learn more about reinforcement learning. The content is 
expected to cover fundamental theories to state-of-the-art research.

```{tip}
While you do not have to know anything about Reinforcement Learning prior to starting with the book, one is expected to
have some previous experience with `Calculus`, `Linear Algebra`, `Probability Theory`, and `Statistics`.

Furthermore, for software implementations, `Python` will be used. Within Python, we make use of well-known packages to 
make our lives easier, such as `Pytorch`, `OpenAI Gym`, `Numpy`. If you are interested in the practical side 
of the book, please make sure you have a basic understanding of these software packages.
```
